                We usually process with our comprehensive refund process as soon as we receive a request from our client. However, there might be some delay in the process at times.  If you haven’t received your refund amount as per the suggested deadline, we would request you to contact your bank to confirm the same. In some cases, the bank takes time to show up it in your account while the amount has been credited to it.
                If your bank says that the amount has not been credited to your account then we request you to write us at:
                info@ptepromocode.com
                Or
                Call us at: +91-7434-009400
                We will immediately look into the matter and update you regarding the same.
                Note: Any national holidays might delay the refund process a bit. Kindly take this into account.
